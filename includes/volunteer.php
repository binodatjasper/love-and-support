					<h2>Become A Volunteer</h2>
					<p>The purpose of the Love & Support Foundation is to help those in need. In order to manage such support, regular and contingent support is collected from the members of the organization. Our aim is to ensure that children are not deprived of access to education. We will always strive for the necessary coordination and possible assistance for the treatment of patients who have not received medical treatment. For the rescue and assistance of any disaster victims, this organization will manage the assistance by setting up a permanent fund.</p>
